# Description

This repo contains refined code for server to control [Freenove 4WD Smart Car Kit for Raspberry Pi](https://github.com/Freenove/Freenove_4WD_Smart_Car_Kit_for_Raspberry_Pi).

## How to use

Install all dependencies according to original tutorial, then connect to your Raspberry Pi and run in terminal:

```shell
cd server
sudo python main.py
```

To exit, press `Ctrl+C`.


## Motivation

I'm planning to play a bit with extra capabilities, so would need to adjust server/client code a bit, but found original quite difficult to extend.

The code in the repo is not very idiomatic too, I'm planning to address this later (maybe).
